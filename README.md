# Summer 2025 [13 Jul - 20 Sep]

This repo is there to layout my goals and aspirations for the coming season.
This includes things like projects to work on, a roadmap, and some of my general goals related to programming and technology.

## Focus

My main focus of the summer season will be to expand my knowledge when it comes to C programming, through learning tools like cmake for example or using other programming tools.
I also have some secondairy goals, of which I find learning more about computer internals through assembly or Arch for example, but I also wanna learn some other languages like Rust and Java to broaden my horizon.
I'd also like to work on some other off topic projects, like doing some self-hosting and doing a little fresh up on DSA, but the emphasis will be laid on the points given above.

## Goals

Now I'll create a basic layout of all of my goals for the coming season. This doesn't include projects I want to build, but rather the **concepts** and **toolchains** I want to master.

### Main goals, high priority

---

#### Build Tools
- [ ] Master `make`
- [ ] Master `cmake`
- [ ] Create multi-target build setups (executables + libraries)
- [ ] Understand `compile_commands.json` and IDE integrations

---

#### Testing Frameworks
- [ ] `cmocka`
- [ ] `criterion`

---

#### Code Quality & Analysis
- [ ] Learn `valgrind` (memory leak and invalid access detection)
- [ ] Learn `clang-tidy` (style + bug detection)
- [ ] Use `cppcheck` (static analysis)
- [ ] Use `gcov` (code coverage)
- [ ] Use `addr2line` (decode crash addresses)
- [ ] Try `ASan` and `UBSan` (sanitizers for memory & UB)

---

#### Debugging
- [ ] Master `gdb` basics (breakpoints, stepping, stack traces)
- [ ] Use `.gdbinit` for automation
- [ ] Debug segmentation faults using core dumps
- [ ] Try remote debugging or debugging child processes

---

#### Linking & Libraries
- [ ] Create and use a static library (`.a`)
- [ ] Create and use a shared library (`.so`)
- [ ] Understand symbol visibility and `nm`, `ar`, `ld`
- [ ] Learn runtime loading with `dlopen()` / `dlsym()`

---

### Secondairy, medium priority

---

#### Other build systems
- [ ] Master `meson` + `ninja`

---

#### Documentation
- [ ] Write inline documentation with `doxygen` comments
- [ ] Generate static HTML docs with `doxygen`
- [ ] Document a reusable C library with README + example

---

#### More testing frameworks
- [  ] `check`
- [  ] `unity`

---

#### DSA
- [  ] Complete 10 more easy `leetcode` problems (start at 10 solved)
- [  ] Complete 10 more medium `leetcode` problems (start at 10 solved)
- [  ] Complete 6 more hard `leetcode` problems (start at 4 solved)

---

#### Performance Tuning
- [ ] Use gprof, perf, or callgrind to profile a C project
- [ ] Optimize memory layout and loop performance in a real benchmark
- [ ] Measure and improve compile times for larger projects

---

### Tertiary, low priority

---

#### Rust
- [  ] Understand basic `Rust` syntax
- [  ] Understanding borrow checker
- [  ] Create a basic project using `Rust`

---

#### Java
- [  ] Learn `Java`'s syntax
- [  ] Create a basic project using `Java`

---

#### Self-hosting
- [  ] Self-host my NAS
- [  ] Self-host `searxng`
- [  ] Reimplement home assistant
- [  ] Self-host `Navidrome`
- [  ] Setup a reverse proxy using `nginx`
- [  ] Self-host `vaultwarden`

---

#### Computer internals
- [  ] Learn some assembly
- [  ] Install Arch Linux


## Projects

There's also a list of projects I wish to pursue in order to broaden my knowledge, these projects are purely C-focused

- [  ] Unix Utility Clones (cat, grep, ls, wc, etfc..)
- [  ] Custom malloc
- [  ] DSA library (installable)
- [  ] File compression tool
- [  ] File encryption tool
- [  ] Basic TCP chatroom on LAN

## Timeline
Just a rough timeline to see what I'm up against for the coming weeks:

- Week 1: Focus on build tools and debugging.
- Week 2-4 (vacation): Do some light DSA, work on the "easier" projects like the Unix Utility clone.
- Week 5-6: Add testing, documentation, and code quality tools.
- Week 7-10: Learn some performance tuning and mess with Rust, Java and self-hosting.

This is the sketch of the coming season, in the background I'll be completing some Leetcode, I aim to do 2-3 exercises per week.
